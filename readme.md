# Vuetify MD Pro in Nuxt Template project


## Features

This project converted the Vuetify MD Pro template into Nuxt. The original non-Nuxt Vuetify-md-pro clone is here:
https://github.com/kathirr007/Vuetify-md-pro-clone. 
It's not as polished as the original  Vuetify Material Dasboard Template from Creative Tim... I use it for prototyping quick POCs.

Technologies:
* Vue.js 
* Nuxt.js
